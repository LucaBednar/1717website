</p><p>Our Sites use these types of cookie:</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Technical Cookies</strong></p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>•	Technical cookies are those used exclusively with a view to “carrying out the transmission of a communication on an electronic communications &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;network, or insofar as this is strictly necessary to the provider of an information society service that has been explicitly requested by the contracting &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;party or user to provide the said service.”</p><p><br></p><p>
